# How to contribute


This crate exists because I find it annoying that it's needed to use `map_err` or `map` so that I can log the results from my functions. However, maybe people find this issue annoying too, and wish to extend upon this basic functionality that `peak-error` provides.

You can use this document to figure out how and where to start.

## Getting started

  - Make sure to clearly describe it.
  - Including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  - Include the version of `peak-error` used.

## Making changes

- Create a branch on your fork.
  - You can usually base it on the `main` branch.
  - Make sure not to commit directly to `main`.
